          <h1>Jonathan Gutzmer</h1>
          <p>I'm a passionate cybersecurity professional with a focus on reverse engineering and malware analysis, and offensive security experience in both malware research and web application testing. Through coursework, home labs, CTF competitions, certifications, and hands-on experience, I've built a solid foundation in cybersecurity. I have coding and scripting experience in Java, PowerShell, Python, Rust, and C, along with a strong understanding of networking, modern web design, and cryptography. My practical skills extend to tools like Ghidra, Wireshark, the Metasploit framework, and Burp Suite, which I've utilized in my professional experience, lab environments, and CTF challenges mimicking real-world scenarios. With excellent communication skills and a relentless drive to learn, I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and refine my technical expertise.</p>

        <h3>Networking Home Lab</h3>
        <div class="project-dates">2025 - Present</div>
        <p class="project-description">I designed and built a home lab network to challenge me with building out a network of products that I've never used before but that I can use daily. The setup includes networking equipment to provide internet across my home, a firewall on the network edge, several ProxMox virtual machines, and VLAN segmentation for the different networks I created. Included in these virtual machines is a local Gitea instance for a private code repository, and a Security Onion instance for monitoring across my network. I also set up a remote access VPN solution for secure access to the network.</p>

        <h3>Malware Analysis Home Lab</h3>
        <div class="project-dates">2024 - Present</div>
        <p class="project-description">I set up a safe environment for analyzing malware samples, initially following TCM Security's Practical Malware Analysis & Triage but then expanding for use in personal projects. The lab setup is fairly simple, including only FlareVM and REMnux virtual machines, and a few other tools such as Pwndbg installed in addition. Using this lab, I analyzed several pieces of malware, starting with simple course material to more complex custom malware. I created analysis findings reports for different malware samples, which can soon be found under the "Write-ups" tab.</p>

        <div class="project-dates">2022 - 2024</div>
        <p class="project-description">Competed semi-annually in HackTheBox's University CTF events and Cyber Apocalypse CTF events, with a focus on the Reversing and Pwn categories. Over these events, I learned a lot about reverse engineering and some of the different anti-reversing mechanisms that can be found in software and how to get past them.</p>

        <h3>Windows Forensics Home Lab</h3>
        <div class="project-dates">2024</div>
        <p class="project-description">I built a Windows forensics lab to practice memory and disk analysis on virtual machines, simulating incident response scenarios. I captured memory dumps and disk images from Windows environments and used tools such as Volatility 3, RegRipper, and Timeline Explorer to extract forensic artifacts. This allowed me to reconstruct user activity, identify persistence mechanisms, and analyze evidence of malicious behavior. The lab gave me a deeper understanding of digital forensics methodology, chain of evidence considerations, and the practical workflow of analyzing compromised Windows systems.</p>
